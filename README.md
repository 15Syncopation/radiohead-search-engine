# Radiohead Search Engine
Just another Wiki program, but I called it "Search Engine"

## What's this program do?
Well, it's serve like other wikis, it has informations about the band, song lyrics, music videos, interviews, article, etc.

# Current Development
This program is still in development, don't expect too much. It has a lot of missing features and you can see how noob the developer is (by looking at the source code).

Your contributions, not always a code, it can be a links to a song, article, news, interview, UI layout, feedback, report of errors, etc.; it's really helpfull for the program.
So, if you have any ideas, suggestions, feedback, good codes, good designs that can be helpfull to the program, don't hesitate to contribute it!

**It's from the community, to everyone.**
