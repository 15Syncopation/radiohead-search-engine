overview = '''Amnesiac is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released in June 2001 by Parlophone. It was recorded with producer Nigel Godrich in the same sessions as Radiohead's previous album Kid A (2000); Radiohead split the work into two albums as they felt it would be too dense for a double album. As with Kid A, Amnesiac incorporates similar influences of electronic music, 20th-century classical music, jazz and krautrock. The final track, "Life in a Glasshouse", is a collaboration with the Humphrey Lyttelton Band.

After having released no singles for Kid A, Radiohead promoted Amnesiac with the singles "Pyramid Song" and "Knives Out", accompanied by music videos. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number two on the US Billboard 200. By October 2008, it had sold over 900,000 copies worldwide. It is certified platinum in Canada and the US.

Though it disappointed some hoping for a return to Radiohead's earlier rock sound, Amnesiac received mainly positive reviews and was named one of the year's best albums by numerous publications. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize and several Grammy Awards, winning for Best Recording Package for the special edition. "Pyramid Song" was ranked one of the best tracks of the decade by Rolling Stone, the NME and Pitchfork. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked Amnesiac number 320 in their updated version of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.'''
