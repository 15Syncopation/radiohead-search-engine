overview = '''A Moon Shaped Pool is the ninth album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was released digitally on 8 May 2016, with CD and vinyl releases in June 2016 through XL Recordings. It was produced by Radiohead's longtime producer Nigel Godrich, with artwork by singer Thom Yorke and longtime collaborator Stanley Donwood.

Radiohead recorded A Moon Shaped Pool in southern France. It features strings and choral vocals arranged by guitarist Jonny Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra. Several songs, such as "True Love Waits" and "Burn the Witch", were written years earlier. The lyrics address climate change, groupthink, and heartbreak; many critics saw them as a response to singer Thom Yorke's split from his partner Rachel Owen. Donwood created the abstract cover art by exposing his paintings to weather.

Radiohead promoted A Moon Shaped Pool with singles and videos for "Burn the Witch" and "Daydreaming", a viral campaign of postcards and social media posts, and a series of video vignettes. A world tour began in May 2016, with legs in 2017 and 2018 and headline performances at festivals including Glastonbury and Coachella. The tour included a performance in Tel Aviv, which drew criticism from supporters of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, a campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel.

A Moon Shaped Pool appeared in many publications' lists of the year's best albums. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for "Burn the Witch") at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. It topped the charts in several countries, becoming Radiohead's sixth number-one album in the UK, and was a bestseller on vinyl. It was certified gold in the UK and US in 2018.'''
